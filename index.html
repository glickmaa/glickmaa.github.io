		<p>Hi, this is my personal website.
		I created this in my Software Carpentry workshop during SURF 2021.</p>

		<p>I will hopefully be adding updates soon so that some of the work I am doing this summer shows up here. Enjoy!</p>

                    <h2>Research</h2>
		<p>Here is a summary of my current and past research.</p>
        <h4>SURF Project</h4>
        <p>During the summer of 2021 I am working at Scripps Insitute of Oceanography in the SURF program.<br>
        I am working in the group of Dr. Fiamma Straneo to study the interaction of ocean currents of the coast of the Sermilik Fjord in Greenland.<br>
        I hope to be able to keep track of some of my work here.</p>
        <h4>Pulsar Research</h4>
        <p>At Oregon State University I am working in the research group of Dr. Xavier Siemens to detect and identify potential pulsar candidates as part of the national collaboration NANOGrav.<br>
        Pulsars are an excellent tool for detecting gravitational waves in the universe. In particular, milisecond pulsars are extremely regular in oscillation, so we can use any irregularity to identify massive objects in space.</p>
        <h4>Mathematics Education</h4>
        <p>From 2020-21, I worked with Dr. Rebekah Elliott at Oregon State University on a project that investigated the ways that mathematics teacher candidates learn computational thinking through basic computer science modules.<br>
        I used a linguistic lens to examine the ways the teacher candidates moved between academic disciplines by comparing to multilingual communication.<br>
        Here is a link to the Honors Thesis I wrote as part of this project, titled "Connecting computational thinking and mathematics: an examination of linguistic opportunities and challenges": <a href="https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/concern/honors_college_theses/6d570398h" target="_blank">Glickman HC thesis archive</a>. </p>
