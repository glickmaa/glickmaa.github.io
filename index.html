<h1>Abbie's Personal Website</h1>

<p>Hi, this is my personal website.
I created this in my Software Carpentry workshop during SURF 2021.</p>

<p>I will hopefully be adding updates soon so that some of the work I am doing this summer shows up here. Enjoy!</p>

<p style="color: #7B27C1";>This is a test for using colors in a paragraph. Hopefully it shows up :)</p>

<p>This paragraph is to test a line break.<br>
This will show up on a new line even though it is in the same paragraph.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the UCSD website. <a href="https://ucsd.edu"> UCSD site</a></p>
