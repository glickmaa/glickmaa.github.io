This is my first attempt at a personal website.

Most of what I will be doing is modifications from various resources on the web.

For instance, the W3 Schools pages are extremely helpful for modifying code to fit my needs.

I will be working with html, css, and js at the moment, although these are all new to me.

We'll see where this takes me!
